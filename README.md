# About This Project
This was a simple project with a self-induced deadframe of 1 month. I made it during college in 2020-2022 for the phone. It never got uploaded, but was fun none the less. The main objective of the game is to shoot down as many spaceships before dying.

# Highlights
* Planet Mesh Generation: The planets were generated using my own custom mesh generation. It wasn't very good, but I had a lot of time to learn about how 3D meshes are created. It was very fun, despite the hours of mental frustration I had tring to make a good looking and well normalized 3D mesh.
* Animations and Models: This was also one of my first attempts at making 3D models and animations. I don't think this model used an actual rig to animate, but I did create the spaceships by hand. I used the star wars X-Wing as a reference, and it didn't come out as terrible as some of my other first attempts at game design.
* Sound Design: The sounds here weren't self made, but I enjoyed the sound manager I created in the game-engine. It was very useful and versatile, because I made a system that allowed me to setup all of my sounds and music in one place, and easily play those sounds from anywhere in the project with a single static method. I found this design approach very useful for Unity, and have implemented something similar in every project I've need one since.

# Insight On Drawbacks and Issues
Mesh Generation was really the only main issue I had here. I think I didn't fully implement the boosts and power-ups in this game, but that's not too much of an issue. The mesh generation still needed a lot of work, but half of my allotted time went into the meshes alone. I would have loved to spend more time working on how the planets looked, but I think if I wanted to try meshes again I would need well over a year to investigate how shaders work to really compliment what I was attempting with meshes and simple materials alone.

# Final Comments
I think this is the only project I've used a deadline on (outside of professional work), overall I think it was a little bit of a stretch doing mesh generation for the first time on top of creating the game. If I had chosen one over the other, I would probably have something that looks and acts better to present. In the end I think it was a very informing endeavor all the same.
